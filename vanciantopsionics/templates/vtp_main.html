            <p>The "Vancian to Psionics" project is a conversion of the standard
            (Vancian) system of magic used by version 3.5 of the <i>Dungeons and
            Dragons</i> role-playing game over to a different (Psionic) system.</p>

            <p>The result is a .pdf with a current page count over 300.</p>

            <p>The project has a <a href=

                <h4 id="statement-title"><a href="#">Read more (for D&D
                fans)</a></h4>

                <div id="statement-body">
                    <p>I am one of those who thinks the psionic subsystem is one of
                    the most elegantly designed things in D&D 3.5. In many ways, I
                    think it's how spellcasting should have been done in 3.5 to
                    begin with. And I'd like to use it for more things.</p>

                    <p>But when I try to replace the core vancian casting with
                    psionics, I run into a couple of problems.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Options are missing. There are things the core classes
                        can do that simply can't be faithfully replicated with
                        psionics. The psionic system is powerful enough, no doubt
                        about that. It can pretty much always get the job done. But
                        if I wanted to, say, play a necromancer, I'd probably have
                        to reflavor Astral Constructs as my zombies and some
                        Stygian powers as my negative energy effects. Which works,
                        but wasn't really what I was looking for in the first
                        place. Which brings me to the second problem:</li>

                        <li>The flavor doesn't always fit. Now, I think it's cool -
                        if viewed on its own terms. The crystals and tattoo theme
                        the books have going on is a perfectly good way to look at
                        magic, but in my experience, it doesn't always live up to
                        people's ideas about what D&D magic "should" look like. DMs
                        still ban psionics for "flavor reasons", or because it
                        doesn't "fit their setting". Which, I must say, I
                        understand perfectly.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>So what can I do? Well, I devised a twofold solution to the
                    twofold problem.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>I translated the core spells and classes over to
                        psionic mechanics.</li>

                        <li>As for the system itself (as well as some doodads like
                        the basic magic items), I changed every reference to
                        "power", "manifester", "crystals" and "psionic", and so on
                        to... well, their arcane counterparts. In other words, when
                        people say "just reflavor psionics to fit your
                        setting/concept" - I'd like to think I did precisely
                        that.</li>
                    </ul>The result, which can be found to the right, includes a
                    complete conversion of the psionic base system, feats and
                    fundamental items over to magical terminology. More
                    importantly, what fans know as the Sorcerer/Wizard, Cleric,
                    Bard, Paladin, Assassin and Blackguard spell lists have been
                    thoroughly translated to psionic mechanics. For classes
                    presented so far, it should be playable from 1 to 20.

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>There's a spell point variant in Unearthed
                        Arcana/the SRD, as well as about 500 homebrew versions.
                        Why, oh why, Ernir, are you trying to invent the
                        wheel?</b><br>
                        The primary difference between this project and every other
                        spell point variant I have seen is simple - I rewrote the
                        spells so that they take the system into account. No other
                        spell point system I have seen has done this. In addition,
                        this isn't really a new spell point system. This is the
                        well known and researched psionic system, which we all know
                        works. I just added a paint job and a new bell or two.</li>

                        <li><b>Did you fix magic forever?</b><br>
                        No, I didn't. My primary goal was to give the vancian
                        flavor a better system, balancing it was not my <i>primary
                        concern</i>. The Wizard class resulting from this is still
                        exorbitantly more powerful than any "mundane" class in WotC
                        D&D, if you ask me. That being said, I did rewrite all the
                        spells, and of course I couldn't resist ironing out some of
                        the kinks I know of. When it came to this, I concentrated
                        my efforts on getting rid of the spells that have truly
                        unbounded/uncontrollable consequences. Wizards can probably
                        still solo most level appropriate encounters, but I hope
                        they'll now run into trouble solo-ing some campaign
                        settings.</li>

                        <li><b>Did you leave some spells out?</b><br>
                        Lots of spells weren't precisely reproduced. Most of those,
                        however, I just merged with others. The augment system
                        provided by psionics makes it particularly easy to merge
                        spell chains (that is, spells that are just greater/lesser
                        versions of other spells). In addition, I merged some
                        spells that I knew would just never be taken as a spell
                        known otherwise.</li>

                        <li><b>Did you add a lot of your own content?</b><br>
                        Mixing the core spells up with my own eccentricities was
                        not my original intent. Nevertheless, I did eventually
                        decide to make up quite a few spells of my own (and steal a
                        few psionic powers), usually to fill in nearly-empty spell
                        levels. Entirely new content has been delegated to its own
                        section, clearly marked near the bottom of the file.</li>

                        <li>
                            <b>Did you change the psionic base system at
                            all?</b><br>
                            A few changes were necessary, for example, changing the
                            discipline/subdiscipline arrangement to fit the
                            school/subschool structure of traditional casting. But
                            I did make some less trivial changes.

                            <ul>
                                <li>Most significantly, save DCs are now calculated
                                using the number of spell points (power points)
                                spent on the spell, rather than the level of the
                                spell (power). Also, you can now spend more points
                                on a spell than given in its spell points (power
                                points) line, usually to increase the save DC (in
                                other words, all spells now have a "null augment").
                                This is mostly because adding "Augment: For every 2
                                additional spell points you spend, this spell's
                                save DC increases by 1." to every single thing was
                                starting to look really ugly.</li>

                                <li>I added a "Polymorph" subschool to the
                                transmutation school to contain the mechanics of my
                                new Polymorph-ish spells.</li>

                                <li>I added a "minion" type of spells to put a cap
                                on the number of will-less minions any given caster
                                can control.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                        <li><b>Are you done working on this?</b><br>
                        No. Next up is to update more magic items, and hack on some
                        epic support. Maybe make some more base classes of my own!
                        I'll be here for a while.</li>

                        <li><b>What are you working on right now?</b><br>
                        New base classes, and trying to find the courage needed to
                        tackle Epic.</li>

                        <li>
                            <b>Can I contribute?</b><br>
